# Snake Game (C++ OOD)

This project is an object-oriented implementation of the classic Snake game developed in C++. The game was built from the ground up using core OOD principles such as encapsulation, composition, and dynamic memory management.

The design centers around reusable classes like objPos for board coordinates and symbols, and objPosArrayList for managing the snake body and game objects. The snake supports wraparound movement, random food generation, collision detection, score tracking, and proper game-over handling.

The project emphasizes clean class design, modularity, and safe heap memory usage, serving as a foundation for future extensions involving more advanced data structures and algorithms.
